        <p>This is a graphql api with crud mutations and queries.</p>
        <p>The playground was intentionally enabled in production to allow you to inspect it.</p>
        <p>Some of the queries/mutations require authorization. You can perform <code>newUser</code> or <code>logIn</code> mutations but in order to persist user that you need to open settings (top-right corner) and change <code>"request.credentials"</code> to <code>"include"</code>. </p>
